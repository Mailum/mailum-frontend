## The Mailum Story

We wanted to have an absolute certainty that our emails remain private and inaccessible to third party. Unfortunately, every service we looked at, had some crucial drawbacks. It was either incomplete encryption, IP-logs, custodial keys (service operators could decrypt user’s emails) or were closed-source.
Having a programming and security background, we decided to build a mailbox with zero-access encryption, which ensures that no one but you can access your data.

## Our Mission is to Make Emails Private again

Privacy is under a lot of pressure. Many powerful entities are focused on erasing privacy worldwide.
The good news is, that just as many, if not more businesses, journalists, activists and computer specialists are committed to keeping the Internet a safe place free from surveillance.

## Join our mission and keep your data in your own hands.

"Having nothing to hide" does not work anymore. Your internet activity is an asset used to influence your purchases, attention and votes. Email service can see what and when you buy, who you talk to, which websites you sign up at. Encrypted email service cannot access any of those information.
